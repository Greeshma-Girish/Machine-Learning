# 📌 Machine Learning Algorithms



## 📖 Overview
The **Diabetes Dataset** contains crucial medical diagnostic data used for clustering and classification. This dataset aids in identifying patterns in diabetes risk through key health indicators such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and heart disease status. By applying multiple machine learning algorithms, we can enhance predictive modeling and medical research.

## 📊 Features
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration (yes/no), indicating blood sugar levels.
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg), measuring pressure in arteries between heartbeats.
- Heart_disease: Presence of heart disease (yes/no), indicating cardiovascular risk.
- BMI: Body Mass Index (kg/m²), assessing body fat.
- Age: Age of the individual (in years), as age is a risk factor for diabetes.
- Gender: Biological sex (Male/Female), as diabetes risk may vary by gender.
- Outcome: Class variable indicating diabetes status (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes).


## 🧠 Implemented Algorithms
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding the dataset through visualization and statistics.
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) – A classification algorithm that groups similar data points.
- Naïve Bayes – A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
- Decision Trees – A tree-based model for classification and regression.
- Regression Models – Predicting continuous outcomes based on input features.
- Clustering (e.g., K-Means) – Identifying groups of individuals based on health indicators.

## 📌 Conclusion

Since the dataset includes a **target column (Outcome: 0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)**, it is best suited for **classification algorithms**. These models analyze key health indicators such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and heart disease status to predict diabetes risk effectively.  

###  **Top Performing Algorithms**  
- **📊 Logistic Regression** – Provided a strong baseline performance with high interpretability.  
- **📌 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** – Performed well with clear patterns in the data but may be slower with large datasets.  
- **📈 Naïve Bayes** – Efficient and fast, though it assumes feature independence, which may not always hold.  
- **🌳 Decision Trees** – Captured complex relationships but prone to overfitting without pruning.  
- **🔍 Clustering (e.g., K-Means)** – Helped identify groups of individuals based on similar health metrics but isn’t used for direct classification.   

### 🚀 **Final Conclusion**  
 KNN Classification is the best-performing algorithm for diabetes prediction, offering high accuracy and robustness.
The final choice should be based on evaluation metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC scores** to ensure the best fit for the dataset.
